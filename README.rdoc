= Installation
In your gemfile
    gem 'fancygrid', :git => 'git://github.com/giniedp/fancygrid.git'

or for specific tag
    gem 'fancygrid', :git => 'git://github.com/giniedp/fancygrid.git', :tag => "1.0.0-pre"
    
Run
    bundle install
    
and
    rails g fancygrid:install
    
then follow the instructions

= Getting started

== Basic Setup
In any controller in any action you can define a fancygrid for a specific model.
A controller is the place where you define what data should be queried from
the database and what columns will be visible. For example you could define
a table for your users like this:
=== Example
    # UsersController
    def index
      # setup fancygrid to display users
      fancygrid_for :users do |user|
        
        # specify attributes to display  
        user.attributes( :id, :username, :email )

        # specify the callback url for ajax loading
        user.url = users_path
        
        # finally call find with some customized find options
        user.find( :order => "users.created_at DESC" )
        
      end
    end
  
In your View you have to render the fancygrid. Use the name that you have used
in your controller
=== Example
    # app/views/users/index.html.haml
    = fancygrid :users

== Static tables
If you dont want to have an ajax table, you can set the data directly without
providing a callback url. 
=== Example
    def index
      fancygrid_for :users do |user|
        
        # ...
        
        # dont set the url and find options like in the first example
        # instead set the data directly
        user.data= User.find(:all)
        
      end
    end
   
== Table names and model names
Usually fancygrid takes the passed name and tries to resolve the models class
and its database table name. If you need to use a name that is different
from your models name which is the case when you have namespaced models, you can 
pass the models constant and its table name to fancygrid
=== Example
    def index
      fancygrid_for :user, Namespace::User, "users" do |user|
        
        # ...
        
      end
    end
    
= Using methods on records
You are not limited to the models attributes to display in the fancygrid. You can
provide method names to display a models properties
=== Example
    def index  
      fancygrid_for :users do |user|
      
        # ...
        
        # specify methods to call on each record
        user.methods(:full_name, :some_other_method)
        
        # ...
        
      end
    end
    
You can even pass a proc to a single column
=== Example
    def index  
      fancygrid_for :users do |user|
      
        # ...
        
        user.proc( :roles ) do |record|
          record.roles.map{ |r| r.name }.join(", ")
        end
        
        # ...
        
      end
    end
    
For more complex output you must have to render a column with custom template

== Rendering columns with templates
For custom cell rendering create a template at some place like *app/views/fancygrid/users.html.haml*
In your fancygrid definition do:
=== Example
    def index  
      fancygrid_for :users do |user|
      
        # ...
        
        # specify cells that will be rendered with custom code
        user.rendered(:actions)
        
        # set the templates name 
        user.template = "fancygrid/users"
        
        # ...
        
      end
    end

In your template you can use the following locals: <tt>table</tt>, <tt>column</tt>, <tt>record</tt> and <tt>value</tt>
so you can render your cell like this:
=== Example
    - case table.name
    - when :users
      - case column.name
      - when :actions
        = link_to "Show", user_path(record)
        = link_to "Edit", edit_user_path(record)

== Rendering columns with a haml block
In your view you can give a grid a block that should be used for rendering
=== Example
    = fancygrid(:users) do |column, record, value|
      - case column.name
      - when :actions
        = link_to "Show", user_path(record)
        = link_to "Edit", edit_user_path(record)
        
== Display associated data (belongs_to or has_one)
To display an associated data you have to build the nodes for that data and
specify the include option for the find method
=== Example
    def index  
      fancygrid_for :users do |user|
      
        # ...
        
        user.columns_for(:contact) do |contact|
          contact.attributes( :first_name, :last_name )
        end
        
        # ...
        
        user.find( :include => :contact )
        
      end
    end
    
If your association name is different from the models name pass the model 
constant into the columns_for method.
=== Example
    def index  
      fancygrid_for :users do |user|
      
        # ...
        
        user.columns_for(:work_address, Address) do |address|
          address.attributes( :street, :zipcode, :city )
        end
        
        # ...
        
        user.find( :include => :work_address )
        
      end
    end
    
== Display associated data (has_many or has_and_belongs_to_many)
Similar to the previous example you have to build the nodes for the associations
and specify the include option
=== Example
    def index  
      fancygrid_for :users do |user|
      
        # ...
        
        user.columns_for(:roles) do |roles|
          roles.attributes( :name )
        end
        
        # ...

        user.find( :unclude => :roles )
        
      end
    end
    
However this would not work as expected. Its the same as calling <tt>user.roles.name</tt>
which would call <tt>name</tt> on a collection of roles.

Instead you should rather define a <tt>proc</tt> to return all role names or 
render that cell with custom code.
=== Example      
    def index  
      fancygrid_for :users do |user|
      
        # ...
        
        user.proc( :roles ) do |record|
          record.roles.map{ |r| r.name }.join(", ")
        end
        
        # ...
        
      end
    end

== Order your conditions
If you have a large condition to make or you want to use a condition that depends on a users role, for example when
some of your users are not allowed to see specific data, then you can give the find method a block and use the query generator

=== Example
    fancygrid_for :users do |grid|
      
      # ...
      
      grid.find do |query|
        # all the conditions are joined with an AND operator
        query.conditions(["users.first_name = ?", "some name"])
        query.conditions(["users.last_name = ?", "some name"])
        
        # use other finder options as methods
        query.select #...
        query.order  #...
        # ...
      end
    end
    
== Caching the view state
To make your users life easier you can enable the view state caching. This way
the user can search for data, leave the site, come back and have his last
search back on screen. Here is an example of how to store the view in the users session:
=== Example
    # ensure that there is a hash in the session
    session[:users_table_view_state] ||= {}
    
    fancygrid_for :users do |grid|
      
      # ...
      
      # specify a proc to load the view state
      grid.load_view_proc do |grid_instance|
        session["fancygrid_users"] || {}
      end
      
      # specify a proc to store the view state
      grid.store_view_proc do |grid_instance, dump|
        session["fancygrid_users"] = dump
      end

    end
    
Its up to your business logic where and how you store the dumped view state. If you have lots of tables 
i would recommend to enable database session store.
